Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP l_fir_filter/r_mult_reg[3]0 multiplier stage l_fir_filter/r_mult_reg[3]0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC IOSR-1] IOB set reset sharing: IO sd_rx connects to flops which have these i2s_transceiver_0/l_data_tx_int[15]_i_2_n_0, and i2s_transceiver_0/sclk_int_i_3_n_0 set/reset signals.  For optimal IOB flop packing there should be only one set/reset signal coming into the IOB.
